# News Web Page
## Application of a news API

# About this site
This site was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Using the API, I was able to create a paginated landing page for the site. The paginations loops through the data provided from the API and display them page by page.

Clicking the news should take you to a new page thatâ€™ll display the news selected with images and comments.

I also made use of modular JavaScript to integrate the functionality into the site.
